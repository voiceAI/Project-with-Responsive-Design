        <span class="bold"> What is Search Engine Optimization (SEO)? </span>
        <p>


            Search Engine Optimization is the process of maximizing the number of visitors to a particular website by
            ensuring that the site appears high on the list of results returned by a search engine.
        </p>
        <span class="bold">What is Voice AI Search Engine Optimization (VoiceSEO)?</span>
        <p>
            Once a web site is optimized for the essentials of (SEO), Voice AI search engine optimization (VoiceSEO) can
            be practiced. Voice SEO includes the process of using conversational artificial intelligence (AI), by
            vocally or manually submitting a question, fragments of words, and or request. Once the submission is
            queried, the
            conversational AI will provide the most accurate and dominant answer/result to the individual submitting the
            query. Voice SEO includes back-end SEO, machine learning, and conversational AI.

        <span class="bold">Why does my brand need to be prepped for Voice AI Search Engine Optimization
            (VoiceSEO)?</span>
        <p>

            It is important for your website to be voice AI search engine optimized so that individuals interacting with
            your site utilizing conversational AI will be provided with the most simplified search results for

        <p>
            Now that you’ve made sure your site is equipped with SEO basics. Subject matter experts suggest that your
            website is accessible and inclusive in design on all search engines.
        </p>


        <span class="bold"> How does machine learning in search work?</span>


        <p>
            Before moving forward and thinking of machine learning we must understand how search engines crawl, and
            index websites. We must understand how search engine algorithms function.
        </p>

        <p>
            Search engines treat user intent as ranking signals. We must know of their importance.
        </p>



        <span class="bold"> How does machine learning actually impact search and seo? </span>

        <p>
            We first must understand what Machine Learning is.
        </p>
        <p>
            Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systemsuse
            to progressively improve their performance on a specific task.
        </p>
        <p>
            Machine learning is not the same as artificial intelligence (AI).
        </p>
        <p>
            AI is the science behind creating systems that resemble human-like intelligence and process information in a
            similar manner. AI is also unpredictable in many ways. Regarding SEO/VEO the AI will be able to add newdata
            and calculate new techniques depending on what is required from the search engine.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use machine learning to solve problems. Machine Learning works mathematically to produce the
            SEOtechniques and solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Google’s search engine’s primary algorithm is RankBrain.
            RankBrain is an algorithm learning artificial intelligence system, the use of which was confirmed by Google
            on October26,2015. It helps Google to process search results and provide more relevant search results for
            users.
        </p>
        <p>
            The machine learning aspect of RankBrain is what sets it apart from other updates. To “teach” the RankBrain
            algorithm to produce useful search results, Google first “feeds” it’s data from a variety of sources. The
            algorithm then takes it from there, calculating and teaching itself over time to match a variety of signals
            to a variety of results and to order search engine rankings based on these calculations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Google’s core algorithm which uses machine learning (the ability of machines to teach themselves from data
            inputs) to determine the most relevant results to search engine queries. Pre-RankBrain, Google utilized its
            basic algorithm to determine which results to show for a given query. Post-RankBrain, it is believed that
            the query now goes through an interpretation model that can apply possible factors like the location of the
            searcher, personalization, and the words of the query to determine the searcher’s true intent. By discerning
            this true intent, Google can deliver more relevant results.
